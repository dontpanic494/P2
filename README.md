## Comments
In addition to learning loads of PHP, I read up a bit on .gitignore files and how they're typically implemented. In my case, I just wanted to ensure that .DS_Store files were omitted from my repository becuase they're remarkably annoying. I included the file in my repository for this project - I'm not sure if I will going forward.
